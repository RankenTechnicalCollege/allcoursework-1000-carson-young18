        <dd>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of the HTTP protocol that provides secure communication over a network, such as the internet, by encrypting the data exchanged between a client (e.g., web browser) and a server (e.g., web server). HTTPS is commonly used to protect sensitive data transmission, such as user login credentials, personal information, and financial transactions.</dd>

        <dd>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a TCP/IP-based network, such as the internet. FTP is a widely-used protocol due to its simplicity and effectiveness in managing file transfers. However, it has some security concerns, which have led to the development of alternative protocols such as SFTP and FTPS.</dd>

        <dd>The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical network protocol that enables the internet to function smoothly by translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses, which are numerical identifiers for devices connected to the internet. This translation process is often referred to as “resolving” domain names.</dd>
